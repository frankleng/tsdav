## v1.1.1

**improvements**

- Fixed spread params for new way of creating dav client, thanks to @molaux
- Ensure service discovery redirect maintains the proper port, thanks to @n8io
- Fixed a time range issue with new time range format

## v1.1.0

**breaking changes**

- `DAVClient` is no longer a type returned by `createDAVClient`, instead it's a class that can be instantiated.
- `timeRange` in `fetchCalendarObjects` is now validated against `ISO_8601` standard and invalid format will throw an error.
- typescript target changed to `es2015`, if you are on `node >= 10` and `browsers that are not IE and have been updated since 2015`, you should be fine. support for `es5` output is not possible with added `esm` support.

**features**

- added a new way to create `DAVClient` by `new DAVClient(...params)`.
- added support for `esm`.

##### improvements

## v1.0.3
